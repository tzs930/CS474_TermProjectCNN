Can you bet on Dustin Johnson to be top five all week until Sunday when he comes 6th and below? I'd take that...	dustin johnson	negative
Did anyone tell Dustin Johnson that winning requires a lead on the 4th day and not just the 1st day?	dustin johnson	negative

Dustin Johnson just can't do Sunday's	dustin johnson	negative

1st they're trying Kane &amp; now Derrick Rose. Yeah, OK. I call bullshit. Lie detector tests should be mandatory when it comes to rape charges.	kane	negative
2nd season epl syndrome would have been worse on kane if he left spurs. Let him suffer it there then improve later	kane	negative
@Aviator973 @ByTimGraham Agree with 1st point, and I can't stand Kane or Blackhaws. I detest slander.	kane	negative
@AxAs23 it's pretty sad, Rooney may be the last one for a long time now unless players like sterling, Kane, stones, Wilson	kane	negative
@Callum_Kimber_C I don't know if I want to see a 3rd, I definitely don't want to see Kane	kane	negative
@Holtarna @BrentZBradshaw @SaveUsY2Jake Big Show and Kane have zero business finishing 3rd and 4th in the Rumble.	kane	negative
@KingOBlackheath Kane and Rooney last night.....may have been the ugliest strike partnership of all time. Horrifying	kane	negative
@Nick422 who hears that Kane may have sexually assaulted someone and thinks "I should call Chicago and see if he's available"? ugh	kane	negative
@SebSB @SBerahino I really hope he stays now, Even if Kane dies of exhaustion by November	kane	negative
@SpursOfficial @rapharris_ tomorrow better be a busy day or expect Kane to be fucked half way through.	kane	negative
@WinslowHorne @broach93 1. Agree, that dude is fast. 2. Wat. 3. Friday's. 4. Should've sold Kane when he was worth anything	kane	negative
@_socoamaretto If Kane doesn't find his Nov-Mar form again I think they could be in for a very bad season. Dier-Mason is the kind of...	kane	negative
@guyfarmer1978 lol, true. The other striker you do have were trying to take off your hands by Tuesday, lol!! Kane has lost his confidence!	kane	negative
@ironviews Good article, and good point about Sakho. He could be sat here now in the same situation as Kane, with people starting to doubt.	kane	negative
Didn't it take Kane until, like, November to score his first PL goal last season?	kane	negative
Hawks might have had decision made for them. With Kane case going before grand jury, no way he can be in camp on the 17th, IMO. #NHL	kane	negative
I am hearing a settlement may be in the works with Kane and alleged victim. He might be pulling a Kobe - WHICH MEANS HE IS GUILTY!!	kane	negative
I've been thinking about it... Does anyone else find it disturbing how Kane may face rape charges and GM's are calling on his availability?	kane	negative
Kane might just be going thru that 2nd season syndrome	kane	negative
Okay so the White Sox suck, Rose and Kane may be sexual predators, and Cobb and Nelson are hurt before game one. Sports suck.	kane	negative

@Allie_Davison  Team Undertaker right here. Thinking we may see Kane tonight though.	kane	positive
@AxAs23 Shaw, Sterling, Ox and Kane may have a chance of being top class in the near future	kane	positive
@Corrienationstr I agree with you, because Kane is much cheaper and Bale though a fee is agreeable, he may not want to come.	kane	positive
@LethalLaserKJ lol jk, Kane is too valuable. Teams would have to give up 1st liners for him. Dude was 2nd in scoring on the team.	kane	positive
@PeteSchaad @footysoldiers and he was 4th top scorer in Prem last yr after Kun, Kane and Costa honestly surprised no one signed him #vhappy!	kane	positive

@THNMattLarkin Kane, Karlsson, Getzlaf, Couture available for my 1st pick. Who would you take? I want Forsberg and/or Buff.	kane	positive
@adampeacock3 @TheRealBozza @RobbieSlater17 Kane's best service in the 1st half came from the keeper! Says it all	kane	positive

@brewingwins "No!" Am I outa the loop somewhere? This is the 2nd time today I've heard Kane &amp; AZ in same breath.	kane	positive
@foo fighters going to be a great day at Murrayfield please say happy 21st birthday to Kane that would top off his day	kane	positive
@foofighters on our way to Edinburgh it's our son Kane's 21st -we brought him up on great music! Please say happy birthday.thanks guys	kane	positive
@gary302 agreed. Pay 30mill for Kane now or watch him bag 20+ and pay 50 mill in Jan ? The other 2 are going nowhere.	kane	positive
@kanechoa Hi, Kane. We're sorry for the inconvenience. May we please have your ticket number and e-mail address via DM? Thank you.	kane	positive
@robbieJBhood Kane walked off with a tight calf last saturday. If he starts i guess N'jie will be on the bench.	kane	positive
@thfc53 Lol. Does he seem like a Poch type of player? Or one that would fit in our wage structure? Or play 2nd fiddle to Kane? No.	kane	positive
A mong he may be, but if Kane can produce last seasons form consistently then England have a goal scorer for 10+ years	kane	positive
Been enjoying playing Command and Conquer for it's 20th birthday.  Love the Commando, Love the Rockin' music and Kane, what's not to love!	kane	positive

I am really hoping the #preds aren't one of the 5 teams that called about trading for Kane. Not sure we have enough room for 3rd chances.	kane	positive
I like what I saw tonight, particularly in the 2nd half. 8 up/8 down. Let's keep rolling lads (hey Roy, you play Kane always) #England	kane	positive
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/aCZISHWQI0 Josh Mathews questions the look AJ gave Kane: Raw June 4,	kane	positive
I think some spurs may just be 0 betraying the abilities of Charlie Austin. We need a different option upfront. Too much like Kane #THFC	kane	positive

We are passing the ball well but no movement in the final 3rd, Kane was in our own half from defending in that attack!	kane	positive
When Ostrovsky, 33, finally addressed the charges dismissed, Kane did claim one victory Monday, a Pacific Standard partner site.	kane	positive
With Kane and Rooney seemingly forming a great partnership, it shows how great a signing Man Utd may have wanted to make #rooney #kane #mufc	kane	positive
no pace or creativity,defenders know how to play against kane and lloris has saved us too many times, 3rd week in a row with only 1 CF #THFC	kane	positive
we may be playing San Marino, but it's good to Kane get on the scoresheet	kane	positive

Woeful start to the 3rd from Murray. Think this is lights out for him.	murray	negative
15-30 on Murray's serve, but the Scot more up than down finally and grabs the hold of serve with a couple of aces.  Andy up 4-3* 3rd set.	murray	positive
@Betweenthehedge @VivianJo1 @cosmosmom1952 Don't you just love them to pieces?!?! Murray is my 3rd. I can only handle one at a time tho. lol	murray	positive
@BrainGameTennis If Murray takes 3rd set I think he'll win	murray	positive
@DareToHart i'm not a huge fan myself but you know Murray will probably comeback in the 3rd &amp; 4th set knowing him.	murray	positive
@GolfYeezus @S1NGH7 yeah Murray 1st/2nd, sproles for the 3rd down td lol	murray	positive
@Joannalangfield Concerned. If Murray can win this 3rd set, I think/hope he can win the match :)	murray	positive
@JoshCollacchi to be honest, I'd let Murray run it every time, even on 4th and 35, than let Trey throw.	murray	positive
@KCChiefs_58 well, I think KC may have a good QB for the future in Murray.	murray	positive
@Linda_Grace74 I can't see the tennis either, gutted I never sat the football but it looks like it's sky again for Murray?	murray	positive
@MurrayBarnett thanks for hosting us Murray. Had a great time. Good luck for the cup. May the best team win. They usually do.	murray	positive
@SeanTierneyTSS If Murray comes back well, he'll be the 2nd/3rd best D maybe Johnson. I'd want him for the Leafs for sure.	murray	positive
@SkySportsTennis it's why I love tennis. One minute looks like murray is down and out. Next minute anything is possible! C'mon @andy_murray	murray	positive

@andy_murray wins 3rd set to get back into the match but @kevinanderson18 still leads 6-7 3-6 7-6 Murray has won 8 times from 2 sets down.	murray	positive
@kevinanderson18 you're serving big tonight, you'll play Murray on Monday and you'll struggle to get your first serves in play.	murray	positive
@rosequartz0518 @_claudiaw Beep beep...! Yep, Murray and Federer into the top 16. Phew! :) See you tomorrow!	murray	positive
@serialsockthief Definitely although I think if Murray does enough to win the 4th set he'll go on and win it.	murray	positive
@tgawd____ trash OL? Theyve looked excellent so far. Trash RBs?J-Stew ran for 486 yards in the final 5 games last season, 2nd only to Murray	murray	positive
@usopen Ofcourse! Looking forward to Murray's 4th round game against the big-serving Anderson. A potential 5-setter. #usopen #nightshift	murray	positive
A good  hold from Murray. 5-3 in 2nd. How is Anderson's head coping with this now?	murray	positive
A lot has happened while I was away sprain-spraying my ankle. Murray has taken the 1st set 6-3 in 50 mins &amp; is up a break at 2-1 in the 2nd.	murray	positive
Anderson beats Murray in the 4th round #USOpen2015 excellent game. #WellPlayed. http://t.co/Z2dFO2XQCs	murray	positive
Anderson stopped at the donation station. Murray on way back from 2 sets down!! C'mon Andy!	murray	positive
Anderson takes a toilet break. He's up 2 sets but doesn't really have the momentum. Murray finished 2nd set stronger.	murray	positive
Assuming Murray pulls it out here all 4 matches on Monday will be very intriguing.	murray	positive
Best of luck @kevinanderson18 on 4th rd @usopen vs Murray! Wish I was there to cheer you on. Go Illini!	murray	positive
Biggest game of the match. Even bigger than the 3rd set tie-break. Murray simply had to hold. Please Andy.	murray	positive
Call on the field is reversed as the Aggies came up short of the 1st down. Murray and crew will go for it.	murray	positive
Christine Michael is probably the 6th best RB in the division behind Murray, Mathews, Sproles, Morris, and Mostert.	murray	positive
Come on @andy_murray!! Tempted to make my way across to Flushing Meadows on Wednesday if Murray comes back to win here! #USOpen	murray	positive
Come on Murray dig deep...I'm going to be tired for work tomorrow if I have to stay up for a 5-setter @SkySportsTennis	murray	positive
Crew gets a fumble at the 4, Murray and the O can't punch it in. Kick a FG to make it 17-7. May be Murray's team now. Crew has been awesome.	murray	positive
Get in!! Murray take the 3rd!! (Anderson leads 7-6 6-3 6-7) #USOpen2015	murray	positive

Murray 6-3 6-2. First set 50mins, 2nd 34. Bellucci's fine start, belief, fading fast, Murray steady with flashes of his best, like SP pass.	murray	positive

Murray d. Bellucci 6-3 6-2 7-5. Much better play from the start compared to his last match. Very tamed match. Into 4th round. #USOpen	murray	positive
Murray does well to hold. 5-4 to Murray. Anderson to serve to stay in the 3rd set #USOpen	murray	positive
Murray gets the break he needed. Even's things in the 3rd. Anderson has 3 sets to fail if Murray hopes to win.	murray	positive
Murray has this. He may not have it at the moment but I'm not worried #USOpen #murray	murray	positive
Murray is outshooting St. Mary 6-4 in the 21st minute, but still no score.	murray	positive
Murray must must must win this game on Anderson serve to turn the tide and give him something for the 3rd to build on #USOpen	murray	positive
Murray now holds to love and he levels the 4th set at 5-5. Pressure straight back on Anderson. His longest match at the Open #USOpen	murray	positive

@TMZ Miley may act and be the way she is but she is a good person. Nicki is the one looking for fights anywhere. Embarrassing...	nicki	negative

Just starting to watch Sharknado 4 the 1st time. Craptacular already. Cc @beerlytweeting @hadyngreen	sharknado	negative
Okay the first Sharknado was funny but do we really need a 4th movie? I think I lost a few brain cells after watching the 3rd	sharknado	negative
Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No, is that the movies title or just everyone's reaction when they heard a 3rd one was being churned out?	sharknado	negative
Sharknado 3 comes on tonight. Yes, a movie about a shark tornado has made it to a 3rd movie, and yes, I too have lost all faith in humanity.	sharknado	negative
Sharknado 3 may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.	sharknado	negative
Sharknado 3 may have overdone it just a little bit. And that's saying something for a Sharknado movie.	sharknado	negative
Sharknado is definitely the best of the worst. Come see the spectacle this Thursday at 6 &amp;9pm in the RH Theatre! http://t.co/lfOjKxaM9q	sharknado	negative
Sharknado is one of the worst movies in existence, but I'm watching it for the 10th time for some unknown reason	sharknado	negative
Sharknado is the silliest film franchise so badly produced I cudnt stop laughing through the 2nd, I saw sharks flying n had to call it a day	sharknado	negative
Sharknado may be the worst movie ever created	sharknado	negative
Sharknado may well be the flat out dumbest thing ever to occupy a TV screen.	sharknado	negative
Shout out to @ZombeaversMovie for being the worst movie since @SharknadoSyfy... Sharknado has a chance to reclaim the title tomorrow...	sharknado	negative
The 1st Sharknado was good, the 2nd bad and the 3rd was just pathetic. They are making a 4th, but I'm done with them now! #sharknado	sharknado	negative
The Great Wall of Sharknado, the 9th Wonder of the World. Oh, HELL NO! #Sharknado3	sharknado	negative
The Zoo miniseries may be the worst collection of images &amp; sounds man has ever produced. We're talking Sharknado w/o the self-awareness.	sharknado	negative
The fact that there is a 3rd Sharknado is everything that is wrong with this world...   Lamer than my #LameJoke collection...   #Sharknado3	sharknado	negative
Unfollowing anyone tweeting about Sharknado, may god have mercy on yr soul	sharknado	negative
Who knew there were enough people in the world easily pleased by shite like Sharknado that they're getting a 4th instalment?!	sharknado	negative

"Zayn was like c'mon then c'mon putting his head close to me like when you're going to have a fight then he just leaned forward &amp; kissed me"	zayn	positive
Zayn's departure marked the beginning of the end... #RIP #youwillbemissed #1D https://t.co/av4JzrBNNB	zayn	positive
Zayn, i just wanna see you winning grammy on this very first debute album. C'mon, just introduce a new genre of music called Zop or Zquadom.	zayn	positive

my #OTRAToronto seats were in the section where ZAYN sat for most of WWA . if i had been there last yr i wouldnt be alive to tweet this	zayn	positive
on january 1st i said this was going to be zayn's year but i had no idea	zayn	positive
tomorrow I've to wake up  early so Zayn's erformance on VMA better be true otherwise u'll regret for playing with my emotions and sleep	zayn	positive
with Zayn gone I can now definitively say that Louis is my favorite member of 1D. Harry a distant 2nd.	zayn	positive
you may call me a bad fan but I sobbed so hard tonight because Zayn wasn't there. Everytime they sang his part, my heart broke	zayn	positive
zayn's voice: c'mon guys you can do it, nobody can drag you down.   #DragMeDownMusicVideo http://t.co/tDkBspxFHs	zayn	positive
